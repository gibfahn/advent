# Advent of Code

Contains solutions for 2016 and 2017 for the [Advent of Code][] in [Rust][].

- 2017 solutions are on the [master branch][]
- 2016 solutions are on the [2016 branch][]

The examples and problems are implemented as tests. Run `cargo test` to run the
tests, and `cargo test -- --nocapture --color always` to see `print` statements
in passing tests.

You should be able to run `cargo doc --open` to build and see the docs for a
given day.
